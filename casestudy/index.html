        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, the class was tasked to create an interactive poster
          for a musical artist, leveraging scaleable vector graphics (SVG) as a
          means for animation and interactivity.

      <section class="challenge">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The largest challenge in this project was using the SVG paths as the catalyst for animation. Javascript was required to select parts of the SVG which could then be used to alter aspects like color and position of the indiviudal elements within an SVG. Requirements for this project included a song that could be paused and played, as well as a looping and non-looping animation. I choose the artist Phish for this project, and specifically their event called "The Baker's Dozen." The theme uses donuts heavily, which was used heavily in the project.</p>

      <section class="solution">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          A number of SVGs were implemented including:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Amplifier logo:</strong> changes color based on the music's state. Pushes in and out when the user clicks.</li>
            <li><strong>"The Baker's Dozen" logo:</strong> spins 360 degrees when the user clicks.</li>
            <li><strong>Falling donuts:</strong> donuts fall at staggered intervals in what appears as tubes in a looping animation.</li>
            <li><strong>Conveyer belt:</strong> another donut repeatedly slides down a conveyer belt.</li>
            <li><strong>Donut bounce:</strong> the sprinkles and frosting of the brown donut pop up when the user clicks.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I used the song "Simple" by Phish was used for this project. Overall the poster's colors and factory feel acomplish the goals I had for this project, and effectively communicate the identity of the event.</p>
